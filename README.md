# Spring Demos

This is a code repository which contains several Spring and SpringMVC web project demos. Including multi methods to realize spring ioc and aop. There are also SpringMVC web project demos integrated with any ORM frameworks like Mybatis,Hibernate and so on in the corresponding directories. 

I've already add a .gitignore file to ignore some local configuration files or build folders. You can download the root directory and import projects you need in any IDE.

It will be used for code sample or beginnerâ€™s reference.
